## Getting started

``` bash
# Clone repository
$ git clone ...

# Install dependencies
$ npm install
```

## Build Setup

``` bash
# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev
# Unfortunately changes in /api force a full server restart (https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/issues/4301)
# Workaround: fast server restart on changes in /api without nuxt reload
$ npm run build
$ npm run devapi

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start
```
